We are huge fans of Ready or Not game! However the game uses Mod.Io for mod support. We didn't find any way to easily subsribe to all your friends mods, so we did this ugly thing.

This uses your own Oauth token and your friends Oauth token. Your friends Oauth is used for fetching all the mods they have subscribed and your own Oauth is used to subscribe it to your own account.

After clicking the button, you can double check from mod.io that all your friends subscribed mods have been subscribed to you also.

Browsers console also gives you more information, in case of any errors!

You and your friend both need to create your own Oauth Token in the Mod.Io.

üòê <b>DO NOT SHARE YOUR OAUTH TOKEN TO ANYONE YOU CAN'T TRUST</b> üòê
